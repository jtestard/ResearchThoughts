### Scalable Transactions across heterogenenous NoSQL Key-Value Data Stores
All data stores assume a client server architecture, where the data store is located on the server and answers queries
sent by the client.

There are applications which require the scalability and dynamicity of NoSQL stores but also require multi-item consistency.

1) One solution is to implement :
 - complex
 - prone to programmer error 

2) Systems which implement transcational capabilities within the system :
 - Spanner
 - Cops
 - Granole
 - HyperDex Warp 

Middleware systems available for multi-item transactional data access :
 - Google Megastore
 - G-Store
 - Deuteromony
 - CloudTPS
 These options have the common issue of requiring homogeneity of the data stores (the set of stores
is known, controlled and intercompatible).
