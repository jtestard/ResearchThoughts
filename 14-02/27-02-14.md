 - Thinking about join reordering algorithm :
 - Problem Statement :
   - Instance : Relations R1...Rn with information about each relation (schema, estimate size of relations and estimate number of distinct value for each attribute of each relation).
   - Solution : a join tree corresponding to the join ordering
   - Assumption : most relations in databases have a relatively small # of attributes. Therfore, we will consider that number as constant. Complexity will only depend on the number of tables and not on the number of attributes in each table.
 - Implementation :
   - could be done in python easily.
   - could be done in java as well.

### Implementation
 - We need a way to generate YAML files with arbitrary relations.
 - We have a simple procedure which follows the book.
