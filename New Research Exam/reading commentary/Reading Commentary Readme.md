## Research Exam

There are four research labs (flagship paper listed here) we want to focus our ideas on :

 1. Regular MVC web application (ruby on rails and Java Spring are good examples).
 1. IIT Bombay : Database-Aware Program Optimizations via Static Analysis
 2. MIT : StatusQuo - Making Familiar Abstractions Perform using Program Analysis
 3. Tubingen : Embedding of Queries in Ruby
 4. UCSD : Forward and Collage (extra reference would be the query processor documentation). 

They all provide data access optimization on top of application programs, and provide a number of techniques to do so. These techniques fit particularily well in the context of web frameworks (RoR and Spring being two examples). We will do a comparsion between them on a numer of criteria, which are yet to be defined.

The drive of the talk will be the holistic database/app server optimization geared towards performance.
