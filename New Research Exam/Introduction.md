Distributed execution 

## Impedance Mismatch


### Different Languages 

Procedural languages and database query languages are based on different semantic foundations.

 - Data model differences : Nested object vs flat tables
 - Language Paradigm : Imperative programs vs declarative queries

### Different Execution Environments

 - Data duplication across environments
 - Compiler optimization vs query optimization

ORMs allow single language access 

### Query Decorrelation

## ORMs cause inefficiencies

## Program rewriting is the solution
