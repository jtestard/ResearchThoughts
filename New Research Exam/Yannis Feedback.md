#### Comment 1

Stick to the original plan, where the PL connection appears at the end as an "add on" rather than the focus.

So, the more relevant question is:
Outline the slidesets headers.


#### Comment 2

[...] application architecture Consequences of poorly written application code on performance
I cannot see how you will avoid making the application code transformation be a first order problem if that's the introduction.

I would stick the presentation of past works to the issue of set-at-a-time computation Vs loop-based tuple-at-a-time computation.

#### Comment 3

i just said make rows and columns to obtain clarity on how what you do connects with the risks and rewards.
I didn't comment on the risks or the rewards.

You often operate on the "tangent du jour" or, rather, "tangent du mois". So, this is an exercise in systematic decision making.
