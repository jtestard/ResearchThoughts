Loop fission is a bad title. Batching technique (step1 : loop fission, step2 : set-oriented execution)

I think poorly written web application code is a valid target, because 1) it highlights the problem of loop-based querying vs set-based querying 2) "fixing" that problem does not necessarily require program rewriting (FORWARD offers another option based on writing the application declaratively to begin with).
