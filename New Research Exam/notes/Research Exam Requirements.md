## Research Exam Requirements

Detailed requirements can be found [here](http://www.cse.ucsd.edu/node/215). 

Some points :

 - We should validate direction not only with Yannis this time, but also with Ranjit. 
 - An abstract needs to be written in addition to the list of papers before seeing Ranjit.
 - A third member for the committee needs to be found (Sorin Lerner is a good candidate).


### Web Application Environment

#### Baseline

MVC or MVVM Web Framework with database access (Rails or Hibernate or else).

#### Different users

 - I am building an application and I need to build an application with good performance but I am not a SQL expert.
 - I have a big application already and I am unhappy with it's performance, I don't have the means to rewrite the application.

#### Improvements

 - FORWARD
 - Switch
 - DBridge
 - StatusQuo

#### Comparison between frameworks

Criteria for comparison need to arise while reading. Comparison can be supported by examples.

### Examples

We need an example for MVC (both with and without ORM), and show how it is processed by each framework.
