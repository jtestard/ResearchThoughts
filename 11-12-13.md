## SEMI JOIN REDUCTION ##


Finished and Submitted final exam cse 200 this morning. Still on the Kossman paper.

Dynamic Programming for Query processing:

2.2.1
First enumerates all unary plans, and then enumerates binary plans by construction (similar to our DP algorithm).


2.2.2

Cost Estimation for plans : Classic cost model. 


continued lecture required : stop watching movies :p

Recall concept of functional dependency.
Given some Relation R(a1,a2,a3).
We say there is a functional dependency <img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?f:a_i \rightarrow a_j" border="0"/> if :


### SEARCH ###
Topics mentioned in Kossman’s paper:  
 - Semi strucutured Data and XML (Abiteboul)
 - Data management in asymmetric communication environments. (Acharya)
 - broadcast disks (Acharya)
 - push and pull broadcast (Acharya)
 - Heterogeneous databases
 - query caching optimization in distributed metdiator systems (Adali)
 - Compilers and Databases (Aho & Ullman)
 - Scheduling (Apers)
 - database imll using specialized hardware(Apers)
 - Functional Join Processing (Kossman) *important*
 - Database patchwork intenet (Braumandl)
 - multidatabase transaction management (Braumandl)
 - reducing « braking distance » of SQL engine.
 - … list too long to be complete. going only over important flags  only.

 - Distributed Databases, principles and systems. (seems too old to mention any interesting stuff though).
 - Optimization of dynamic query evaluation plans.


My findings is that up to 2000, semi join reduction has not been studied outside of the context of joins. I am now moving on the search to  papers later than 2000.
