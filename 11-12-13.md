SEMI JOIN REDUCTION
——

Finished and Submitted final exam cse 200 this morning. Still on the Kossman paper.

Dynamic Programming for Query processing:

2.2.1
First enumerates all unary plans, and then enumerates binary plans by construction (similar to our DP algorithm).


2.2.2

Cost Estimation for plans : Classic cost model. 


continued lecture required : stop watching movies :p
