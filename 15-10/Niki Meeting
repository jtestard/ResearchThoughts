### Meeting with Niki

I want to discuss the idea of the mapping.

I want to know what she thinks about this mapping :


```
Verification Conditions
=> Loop Invariant + Post Condition in some logic
=> Nested Relational Algebra
```

Basically, the question if she thinks its possible to do this mapping by expressing post-conditions in some logic which is equivalent to nested relational algebra.
