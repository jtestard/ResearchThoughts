# Research Idea Game Plan

It is clear at this point that adding translating procedural language based program into SQL++ will yield great advantages that have not yet been explored in the research arena.

It is clear we can leverage past research to provide us with the analysis and rewriting capabilities to do so, as they do exist for relational data.  To the best of my knowledge, there is no effort in prior research to convert those programs into an expressive semi-structured query language.

What is not clear is which previous work would bring the best leverage. Criteria :

 - Which prior work will allow us to implement with less effort?
 - Which prior work will provide our technique with greatest impact?

We have two candidate techniques :

 - Alvin Cheung's work
 - Torsten Gurst's work

We have yet another candidate work, for which the picture is not that clear yet. 

 - Sudarshan's work

What we need is to go deep enough in each technique to understand appropriate trade-offs. This work has the advantage to be dual purpose : help us with the research idea and provide a better content for the research exam.
