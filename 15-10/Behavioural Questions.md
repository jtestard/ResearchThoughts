# Behavioural Questions

##### Tell me about a time when you had to make a decision without sufficient information. How did the situation work out?

Very recently, I decided to go ahead and try to come with a research idea, which is something new to me, since I mostly relied towards the beginning of my Ph.D. on the directions of my advisor.

The situation was a little scary, because it is half in a domain for which I am not an expert. There are a lot of unknowns, and the solution I have come up with relies on information which I am unable to verify in time, because they rely on deep knowledge of this other field I am unfamiliar with.

I decided to go along and isolate what I don't know from what I do know, and come up with a list of questions for an expert in that field which I hope will confirm my beliefs.

##### Tell me about a time when you had to work with someone who did not like you. How did you deal with the situation? What was the outcome?

This is a difficult question, because other people's exterior behaviour does not necessarily define their inner beliefs. I have had to work with someone who routinely gave me displeasing remarks, criticizing me for the way I would react to work situations. I have found that the best approach was not necessarily to completely cut ties with the person, but give them some extra space. This is why, for example, while I was initially having my office in the same room as the person, I decided to switch to the next room. This extra space has helped make our working relationship much more enjoyable.

##### Describe a decision you made that was unpopular. Why did you make the decision? How did you sell your decision? What was the outcome?

In a work environment, I do not recall having made a decision which affected a significant number of other people that have complained to me about my decision. The best I can think of is a bad scheduling of TA office hours, which I changed after sufficient student request.

##### If you are given an assignment that you don't know how to handle, what would you do?

I would start by understanding precisely how much I don't know, and evaluate the time required to learn the necessary knowledge to successfully perform the task. If I determine that the time it would take me to acquire the necessary knowledge is too long, I would then seek help from someone whom I know is more knowledgeable. I would also try to understand why this assignment was given to me.


##### What would you do if a customer complains about you to your boss?

I would try to reach out to the customer to understand what went wrong, and try to fix the issue with him, while keeping my boss informed of the progress of the situation.

##### Tell me about a time when someone's interruptions were in danger of causing you to miss a deadline. What did you do?

I am fortunate enough not to have encountered that situation, I have been surrounded by very understanding people who left me alone when I told them I was too busy to help. I try to restrict this kind of situation as much as possible.
