ï¿¼Thank you for this advice,


My problem is that I am not sure which directions to go for and a lack of regular meetings that I spend a significant amount of time towards a direction which may or may not be pursued. If you have an opinion about what I should be doing that is clear 


I see that there is a pattern to the problem :

 - There is some interesting work I am doing (for example Asterix SQL++).
 - We have a discussion about what I should be doing the next quarter : I remember I suggested I should do my research exam. You told me that you thought it was a good idea.
 - Obviously, the consequence is then that I have less time to spend on the previous opportunity (Asterix SQL++ in this case) dies down.
 - When it is already too late, you tell me that I should have been doing something else all along.

Back in Spring I did not want to abandon Asterix SQL++. I just thought I had to do the research exam. I am certain that if at the time I had been given the advice: "don't worry about the research exam, focus on Asterix SQL++" I would have done so.

If you have some opinion, it really helps if you give your opinion early on, this way I avoid distractions, because I don't/can't always know they are distractions until after the fact.
