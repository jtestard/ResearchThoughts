### Questions to Niki

 - Does she think we can use alvin cheung's approach to solve the same problem?
 - Is she interested in collaborating or does she know someone else who would be interested in collaborating from her group?


Will need to schedule for early next week a meeting with Yannis given the feedback from both Niki and Ranjit and discuss :

 - What can be done this quarter
 - What cannot be done


Hey Niki,

Thanks again for all the help in the discussion, this shows to me yet again that talking with your peers is the best way to get things moving :). 

While I donâ€™t need to be a verification expert for what I will be doing, I need to write new progams and apply the program analysis on those programs (most likely by hand). The Alvin Cheung paper describe which analysis tool he is using but only points to the seminal papers for those techniques which are not the easiest to understand for a newbie :). From what I understand, the verification he is doing is pretty standard, so there must be some good pedagogical textbook which can help me with this. 

I was only wondering if you had pointers for text books for these tools/techniques :

 - Computing verification conditions using axiomatic semantics (in the presence of unknown predicates) [Computes verification conditions]
 - Constraint-based synthesis using a counter-example guided synthesis algorithm [Describes the space of possible loop invariants]
 - Theorem proving using a theorem prover [validates loop invariants]

If I understand how those three processes work, I should be able to derive the post-conditions I need for any program I want to write.

Best,

~Jules
