#### Research Idea and Niki Discussion

 - Present to her using the research exam presentation. 
 - Does she think we can use alvin cheung's approach to solve the same problem?
 - Is she interested in collaborating or does she know someone else who would be interested in collaborating from her group?

Niki suggested an idea, which would be to just use the output of the TOR and try to derive a single SQL++ from multiple TOR expressions.
