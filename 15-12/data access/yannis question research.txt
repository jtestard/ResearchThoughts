Hello Yannis,

I was thinking of my schedule next quarter. I have :

CSE 232B : Alinâ€™s course on Database System Implementation.
CSE 135 TAing.
Research Exam
Regular research involving decorelation rewritings. 

It will be difficult for me to focus on both 3 and 4. What I would want to do is focus on 3 until I am quite comfortable then spend time on 4.
