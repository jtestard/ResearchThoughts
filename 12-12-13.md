### RETHINKING THE DISTRIBUTED QUERY PROCESSOR ###

We have not yet considered queries in which tables are split across nodes. Is this assumption? Has this assumption been deliberate? Need to ask Kian Win about this.
We also only care in our algorithm about where the relation CAN be stored rather than where they are stored. This should be added to our heuristics.
