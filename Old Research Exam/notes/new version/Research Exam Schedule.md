Research Exam Timeline

Yannis Feedback :

- The initial motivaiton for RDBMS is analytical querying, not transactions.
- Want to be looking for an example in which requirements are fundamentally contradictory. No "tends to" but "must". No solution to the problem in the foreseable future. For document stores, the canonical example is the web log, in which a bunch of heterogeneous objects are thrown in to be read later on.
- Data integration tool for updates : taxido or tuxedo.
- One example involves columns and row stores (in data warehousing context).
- In the talk we see a clash between the co-design and the data integration perspective.
- Data integration systems are born from adaptation to a situation in which control over location of data is not total, while co-design implies total control and explicit choice to use multiple systems.
- Be careful between databases chosen or databases given.
- You can have a 3 step story :
  - Polyglot Persistence : the problem
  - REST interface, common way to do things
  - Federated Middleware : research way to do things.
  - Imperial Middleware : fancy / ambitious way to do things.

Wednesday May 6th : 

 - Come up with the clear representation of the problem.
 - Is polyglot persistnece about data integration or is it about co-design or both?
 - Make sure the motivation of the exam is clear and aligns well with the papers chosen

5-9 hours


Thursday May 7th : 

 - Fix the running example we have in order to guarantee it is convincing. Go for something which would absolutely requires multiple systems. Convince the audience that a "one size solution" is problem that will be continue to be pertinent and is not a temporary issue created by the wealth of specialized systems.
 - Find a complete flow which encompasses all of what he have studied.

8-12 hours

Saturday May 9th :

 - Finish anything that hasn't been done may 7th. Also update the slides according to this new flow.
