Hello Yannis,

I am interested in a book Big Data : Principles and best practices of scalable realtime data systems by Nathan Marz and James Warren ( link : http://manning.com/marz/).
Nathan Marz is the man behind Apache Storm and the Lambda Architecture concept :

 - Blog : http://nathanmarz.com/about/.
 - Apache Storm : https://storm.apache.org/.
 - Lambda Architecture : http://lambda-architecture.net/.


I believe the book is relevant in the context of my research exam. I have not been able to find it through the UCSD library. If I was to purchase the book, would it be possible to expense it?
