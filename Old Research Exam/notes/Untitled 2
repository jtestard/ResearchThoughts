In this paper, we survey existing architectures for PP systems. First, we look at how the surveyed systems integrate multiple specialized systems into a PP system. Second, we look at how the surveyed PP systems handle the data model and query capabilities heterogeneity among the specialized systems. Third, we look at how the surveyed PP systems choose on which specialized system(s) the query will execute. Fourth, we look at how surveyed PP systems store the specialized systems and, when relevant, provision resources for them. Fifth, how the PP system can be updated while preserving integrity in the presence of constraints and redundancy among specialized systems. Finally, we survey how PP systems can be made to allow declarative specification of features such as staleness, availability and flexibility to change in application requirements.
