%Some specialized systems are meant to be deployed on clusters while others are meant to be deployed on individual machines. Should the developer of the PP system choose to deploy his subsystems on a common cluster which she owns or deploy each subsystem on a Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) owned by a third party, or a mixture of both? Should she choose a common cluster, how can she allocate resources to individual subsystems? Some subsystems (especially those coming from the Hadoop ~\cite{Shvachko2010} ecosystem) separate their storage and compute components. Should the developer use the same storage component for multiple subsystems or use different storage components for each subsystem?
