Hello Yannis,

I have decided to go work for Amazon. I have a choice of projects I could be working on : 

 - A new developper-oriented ETL-related service. This is the extent of the details I can give given the NDA I signed.
 - The Redshift product
 - AWS Data Pipeline product (orchestration for data-driven workflows) 

Opportunities within DynamoDB are not clear yet, but I could ask. The start date would be early April, following the end of the Winter quarter.
