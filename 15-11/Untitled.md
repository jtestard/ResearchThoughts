Hello Mehul,

A few points I want to make :

 - First and foremost, I wanted to point out that I am very excited to go to Amazon. I want to do everything to be here as soon as possible. The two points I made earlier (research project & family time) are secondary and are to be taken in the context of the june start date.
 - This would mean I am ready to push for an earlier start date of April 7th. Note that the delay for visas is approximate, meaning there is always a chance my documents arrive later than that date. However, this will not be high visa season, it is most likely the paperwork will arrive on time.
 - I am looking into possibilities to work as a student for Amazon on a part-time basis (20hrs/week) while still at UCSD. I have scheduled an appointment on Monday morning with the international center, and they will give me a confirmation on the feasibility of the project.

Best Regards,

Jules Testard
