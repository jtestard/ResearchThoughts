### Ben Discussion

Where Alvin's algorithm will fail :

 - Identification of code fragment
 - Conversion to Kernel code
 - Hypothesis : there is no expression using the axioms which can represent a result variable

How do we prove the hypothesis?

Solution : try to express all possible TOR expressions over a database and try to obtain the expected nested outcome. Show that without changing some axiom you will not be able to make it.

*Non-formal* : think of the TOR as a grammar which generates words in a possible universe (variables & context). Show that for a nested word, the TOR grammar cannot produce it.
