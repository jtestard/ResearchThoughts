Situation :

 - I entered UCSD as a Ph.D. student, but I wish to graduate as a Master's student.
 - I will have completed all the requirements for my Master's degree by end of Fall 2015.
 - I already have a job in the U.S. right after graduation. I need to find the soonest start date for this job.
 - I was told earlier that in my situation, I could not apply for an I-20 until **after** I had completed **all** the requirements of the M.Sc. program, which will happen at the end of this quarter.

Objective : 

 - Confirm the current plan has no loop holes :
   - Complete all requirements for the Master's program by end of Fall Quarter
   - Enroll for winter quarter (work as T.A. during that quarter and do research)
   - Make a request for a new i-20 as M.Sc. in end-of-december/early january at iCenter with termination date at end of winter quarter 2015 and **get it approved**.
   - Send the post-completion request to HS in early january (need a specific date)
   - I should recieve my EAD card in early April (need a specific date)
 - My employer would like me to work part time while I am doing my winter quarter. I saw that the pre-completion OPT could be used for this purpose. Is it doable if I apply now?
