### Abstract
 - ORM lead to performance inefficiencies in analytics applications.
 - analytics reports can be modeled into a single semi-structured query.
 - SQL++ is SQL with two extensions:
   - distributed access to in memory and database objects.
   - full generality needed by report templating engine
 - SQL++ data model is a superset of JSON.
 - Query optimization problem solved :
   - compilation of SQL++ into set at a time query plan guaranteed, even for analytics queries.
   - normalized and denormalized set-at-a-time query plans are evaluated, and their evaluation validates manyfold speed up over mainstream ORM.
 - normalized sets outperform denormalized sets, especially for analytics reports.
 - query processor integrated and deployed in a web application, including a templating engine.
 
 ### Intro ###
 - impedance mismatch caused between application layer and SQL.
 - ORMS do not compute analytics efficiently.
 - tuple-at-a-time techniques using ORMS such as RoR are particularily bad.
 - normalized techniques better but require advanced SQL knowledge.
 - normalized techniques requires the developer to spell out distributed programming explicitly.

 #### Contributions ####
 - All SQL++ queries are processable
 - Collage rewritings transform tuple at a time into set at a time semantics. The rewritings target :
   - capture aggregation and ranking.
   - are applicable over multiple levels of nesting.
   - handle arbitrary types of correlation between enclosing and enclosed query
 - rewritings should be applied whenever possible.
 - Lightweight integration of external objects : we can get data from external sources such as group on.
