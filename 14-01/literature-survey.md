# Literature Survey

### Instructions
Scan the last 2-3 years of CIDR, SIGMOD, PVLDB, ICDE and see what papers have appeared (if any) on topics pertaining to running various kinds of (natively unsupported) queries and analytics on noSQL and newSQL systems.
 
 - How do you support natively unsupported data through data integration services
 - TOPICS : distributed data integration, data analytics, non-SQL systems

## List of possibly interesting papers
We have found 35 papers which are directly or indirectly to distributed data analytics and integration. Each paper is accompanied by a short description. Papers are sorted by conference and by topics.
