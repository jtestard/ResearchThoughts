### Delphi first meeting ###
 - DELPHI possess health data coming from a number of sources:
   - medical records
   - environmental data
   - spatial data
 - This data is timestamped
 - The application wishes to do integrated data analytics
 - This requires joins based on spatial and local data.
 - The join must be done non-discretely but based on discrete location and space data
   - use range instead of equality for join conditions.
   - use interpolation of points
