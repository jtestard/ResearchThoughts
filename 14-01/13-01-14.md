### Morning ###

 - Talked with Yannis about :
 - excess of decoupling with joins
   - The lambda operator from the data access paper allows to decouple a function from its operator. For example, a function can be decoupled from a join.
   - The definition of the lambda operator is very loose and can lead in some cases to inconsistent queries.
   - For example, an aggregation with a multiple functions that have to be executed in different sources is allowed but physically cannot be implemented.
 - Meeting with Romain at 3pm
 
 
### Semi join Reduction ### 

### Find all possible (useful) rules ###
 - Write down the rule.
 - Show the use of each rule.

#### Identify examples ####
 - examples from rules from the green book and the rule already found.
 - derive rules from what has been previously shown.
 - examples have to be educational :
   - examples have to show the difference between the use and the non use of semi joins.
   - examples may show the use of semi joins or similar techniques.

#### Find variations ####
 - Schema variations :
   - primary keys
   - foreign keys
   - set vs bag semantics
 - Physical variations :
   - indexes
   - network conditions.
   - site on which are applied the operators.

### Meeting with Romain ###
 - Prepare short presentation about what has currently been done and cleaned up (up to super vertex semantics).
