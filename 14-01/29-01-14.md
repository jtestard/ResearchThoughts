### Meeting with Kossman 
 - RamCloud, RDMA
 - changing heterogeneous systems at the data source level instead of the middleware level for optimization.
 
### Meeting with Yannis
 - Went over the survey and semi join reduction.
 - Survey :
   - hStorageDB is out of the list
   - Scalable transactions :
     - what classes of queries are handled?
     - how is the protocol handled. Is it middleware? Do we need to modify the source code of existing systems or do we only require systems to support a given interface?
   - Materialization of SQL Queries :
     - where is the materialization done?
     - what is the setup?
   - Look into more articles
 - Aggregation Rules
   - spotted errors in semi-join reduction, on the push-down aggregation rule, distributed aggregation rule and example 2 (at least).
