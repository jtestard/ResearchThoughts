### Garlic Paper

#### Garlic Intro
 - need to interrelate data stored on different system with varying capabilities.
 - query optimizer for Garlic data intergration middleware.
 - Used a rule based approach in heterogeneous environment.
 - use generic rules for middleware, using wrapper provided rules for encapsulating data sources.
 - we define generic rules for middleware and wrapper provided rules for to encapsulate capabilities of data sources.

#### Garlic System
 - Every data source is a wrapper (hides source interface and enable access to datasource for Garlic's internal protocols).
 - Data model is object oriented (ODMG) : data in source viewed as objects (tables?records?).
 - query processing capabilities are given for each wrapper as a set of rules.
 - system catalog records the global schema, as well as wrapper specifics (note that each data source *must* have a wrapper).
 - garlic has query services (i.e. mediator) with two components :
   - query language processor
     - includes the optimizer
   - distributed query engine
 - regular optimizers (distributed or local) need to know the full set of available execution strategies to find the optimal plans.
 - garlic's optimizer finds good plan without built-in knowledge of data sources and cost.
 - garlic's query engine is able to perform a wide set of operations and allows Garlic t compensate for functionality not present on the data sources, and execute those operations himself.

#### Query Optimization in Garlic
 - Garlic uses a set of STrategy Alternative RuleS, or STARS
 - Garlic's enumerator fires STARs to build plans bottom-up
 - Some STARs are generic
 - Through a dynamic programming algorithm, the optimizer selects a winning plan based on cost
 - The plan is then translated into an executable format
 - Plans in Garlic are trees of operators
 - Operators (or POP) are :
   - join
   - sort
   - filter : select/project
   - fetch : retrieve data from data source
   - temp : temp collection
   - scan : retrieve local data
   - pushDown : encapsulate work to data source (send to wrapper)
   - no aggregation
