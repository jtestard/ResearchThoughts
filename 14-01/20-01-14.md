### Meeting with Romain and Yannis

 - SQL++ allows nested queries in the SELECT, FROM and WHERE clauses.
 - Subqueries in the SELECT clause allow for nested relations.
 - Subqueries in the FROM clause should allow joins between nested relations and other attributes or nested relations.
 - There is a problem about how the apply plan rewriter works with subqueries in the FROM clause.
   - packaging into tuple variables is required
     - we know how to do such packaging with homogeneous sources (such as SQL).
     - we don't know how to do such packaging with heterogeneous sources (such as JSON)
   - we find a way to accomodate for JSON sources.
 - lines are query plans with no binary operators (no joins or apply plan operators).
 - The pipeline should be better defined:
   - AST
   - Initial Plan
   - Plan after apply plan rewriting
   - create cross products from lines
   - optimizations

### Worked out example + extra rule for Semi join reduction.

### SQL practice
 - finished SQL prep
 - don't forget SQL AND statement and end of line semi-colon.
 - semi-join : WHERE EXISTS ( subquery )
 - anti-semi-join : WHERE NOT EXISTS ( subquery) 
 - HAVING SQL Statemnt
