### Semi-join reductions ###
  - work continued on the SVN.

### NoSQL ###
 - created in the 2000s to cope with limitations of SQL.
 - multiple types :
   - document databases : each key is paired with a complex datastructure.
   - graph stores : use to store information about networks.
   - key-value stores : every item is stored as an attribute name ("key") and corresponding value. Some key-value stores allow each value to have a type.
   - wide-column stores : such as Cassandra, are optimized for queries over large datasets.
 - storage model varies depending on database type.
 - storage happens horizontally rather than vertically.
 
### MongoDB ###
 - It is a NoSQL DBMS.
 - key-value store
