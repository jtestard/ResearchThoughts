## Meeting about semi join ##
 - work almost done.
 - investigate one or more rules of the form :
   - \agg ( \agg (S)) = \agg (S) 
   - \agg (R \join S ) = \agg(R) \join \agg(S)
 - think about :
   - associative functions 
   - duplicate eliminations
   - compression
 - clearly state assumption for the model used.
   - motivation
   - normal forms used
   - source specification
   - engine
 - keep use of rules close to them.
 - add one example for the association rules.
 - Each rule has a set of assumption
 - Add directions to rules
 - Each rule has a set of situations in which the rule can be useful.
