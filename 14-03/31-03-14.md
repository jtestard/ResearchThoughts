 - Read Currently under-specified normal forms
 - Update the SQL normal form according to the new set of operators.

### Learning SQL
 - Try example queries using with, having, window operator.
 - Interesting : OVER operator is linked to an attribute in the SELECT clause. One OVER statement is required for each attribute which uses a windowing function. Moreover, each windowing function can take a different partitioning.
