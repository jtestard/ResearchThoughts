### Summary from march 21st meeting
 - This description consists of what I understood from the meeting. If you remember something different, please let me know.
 - Attempt to create a distributed normal form for SQL++ queries using top-down, garlic-like query rewriters.
 - Three options :
   1. It is possible to construct a unique normal form that can accommodate all possible query capabilities.
   2. It is possible to construct multiple normal forms, where each individually may not accommodate for all kinds of query capabilities, but the set of query capabilities by all normal forms is the set of all possible query capabilities.
   3. It is not possible to construct such a normal form.
 - If a distributed normal form can be constructed :
   - We can do source specific operator pull down, which would not be possible using garlic-style rules.
   - We may use the dependency graphs (work from Fall) afterwards.

### Complaints that I have
 - It is not clear what *all possible query capabilities* means. If we want an extensible platform, this cannot be only the query capabilities used by existing query languages. How should we define what we mean by this?
 - I don't think the 2. option is sufficient. Whatever the set of data sources our middleware must handle, we would need a single normal form  that can accomodate all of the restrictions imposed by the query capabilities of these data sources.
