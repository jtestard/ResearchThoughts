### Reading paper by Kian Win and Romain

#### Keywords
 - data model
 - query language 
 - data values
 - schemas and constraints : I am assuming that schemas specify contents of collections.
 - nested data : collection within a collection.
 - missing information
 - semantics for equality on non-scalar and heterogenous
 - semantics for ordering on non-scalar and heterogenous

### Comments

#### Introduction
 - The introduction clearly presents the goals of the survey and how SQL++ is used to specify the various query languages. Nothing to add here.
 - I do not know if the FORWARD paragraph of the introduction is relevant to the survey.
 - I concur romain's comment at the end of the intro.

### Preliminaries
 - The industry product categories are well explained. 
 - However, in the *other* paragraph, it is not clear why Google BigQuery is not put in either one of SQL or NewSQL categories, since it said that BigQuery resembles SQL, but no further details are given.
 
### Data Model
 - On Figure 1 (BNF for SQL++ Values) :
   - What does "name" mean on line 16 : *tuple_value -> {name : defined_value, ...}*. Shouldn't it be "value" or "defined_value"?
 - I understand the difference between primitive and enriched scalar values.
 - I understand the difference between an SQL++ bag and an SQL++ array. However, the naming is a bit strange. An SQL++ array is also a "bag" as a we commonly know it since it can contain duplicate values. Why not change the names to "array" and "sorted_array" ?
