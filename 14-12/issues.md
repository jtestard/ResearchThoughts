## issues

 - Support Full Outer Join (Logical and Physical).
 - Add the rewritten logical plan to the interface output (Jules).
 - Equality on complex values "should" report an error rather than accidently "working". 
 
 - group by, correlated, with clause semantics, 
 - separate "true" from "false" discrepancies.
