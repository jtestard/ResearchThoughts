## Letters of recommendation

 - Gary Scavone :
   - I have been studying in a M.Sc. of Computer Science at UCSD.
   - I am applying to the Computer Music Ph.D. program within the UCSD Music department.
   - I have realized that Computer Music is really what I want to do. This is why I come back to you at this point to request a letter of recommendation.
   - Thank you very much.
 
- Fred hatful :
  - Request letter of recommendation.
  - Write the contents of the letter and put as an example of a good letter.
  - Obviously insist that these are currently my own words, and you should change them to reflect your opinion. This letter is provided as a guideline of what would be requested of a letter.

- Shlomo :
  - Insist of my readiness to conduct scientific research.
  - I probably have more research experience than most applicants, given I was already in a Ph.D. program.

### Fred Letter

Hello Fred,

This is Jules Testard, your summer intern from UCSD. I am applying for a Ph.D. program in Computer Music for next year and I wish to have your recommendation, as the manager of the team I was working on during my summer internship at Yelp.

The recommendation is supposed to show my potential for success in a rigorous graduate program. I have other recommenders who will put forward my musical and academic ability, but your insight would put forward my technical skills and rigor.

I know how busy you must be, so I prepared a sample letter which follows the style of letter the graduate committee would expect. Obviously, these are my words and I expect you to change them to reflect your opinion of my capabilities. You might as well choose not to follow at all this example. This letter is meant merely as a guideline to save time and energy.

I would be extremely grateful to have your support in this endavour.

Sincerly,

Jules Testard

### Gary Letter

Hello Gary,

This is Jules Testard. I was your student two years ago, back then as a McGill undergraduate student with a minor in Music Technology. Since then, I have continued as a Masters student in the Computer Science department at the University of California, San Diego. 

While at UCSD, I have become involved with Professor Shlomo Dubnov and done some projects on Compositional Algorithms. At the same time, I have research done research in databases which culminated with a publication for the ACM SIGMOD 2013 conference. However, I realized that Computer Music (not databases) is what I really want to do, and have started applying for Ph.D. programs in Music Technology.

In this context, I would like to ask for your recommendation again. The letter you have written two years ago about me should be fine, I have other recommenders who are able to give a more recent account of my capabilities.

I would be extremely grateful to have your support in this endeavour. 

Sincerly,

Jules Testard

### Shlomo Dubnov

Hello Shlomo,

I am writing this email in the context of the recommendation letter for the Ph.D. application. You have asked what to put forward in your recommendation. I think the things that will be the most important for the committee to know are :

 - My involvement in Computer Music prior to coming at UCSD. I have had the luxury of already taking Computer Music courses such as Music & Audio Computing, Music perception and cognition, Digital Audio Signal Processing.
 - My involvement and motivation with the iPhoneComposer in the Compositional Algorithm classes.
 - Coming from a rigorous Ph.D. program, I have had much more exposure to scientific research than probably most other applicants (in Computer Science, which is sufficiently close to Computer Music to be relevant).
 - Having a much more complete package in computer science than most other applicants. I have taken graduate courses in operating systems, database systems, compilers, 
 

Thank you so much for helping me in this endavour. I am truly grateful.

Sincerly,

Jules Testard
