### Dynamic Dispatch on Asterix API Framework

Dynamic dispatch : replacing case analysis by polymorphism. 

(AQL/SQLPP Query) accepts an (AQL / SQLPP Visitor)

The AQL/SQLPP query have a superclass called IQuery which they can use

We can create IExpressionVisitor as a super interface for the AQL/SQLPP Visitors.

Only problem, such a class would create a dependence between the aql and sqlpp packages.

Full dynamic dispatch is not possible, because it would require making the asterix-sqlpp classes available from within the asterix-aql package which violates the dependence tree between those packages. The only solution to make this work would be to merge the asterix-aql and asterix-sqlpp modules, which might/might not be a good idea.

We can at least avoid the use of instance_of using the QueryLanguage enum.
