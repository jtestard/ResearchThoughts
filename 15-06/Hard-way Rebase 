Two options 

### Hard-way Rebase 

```
git rebase -i master
```

Pick all commits rebase by hand, at the risk of redo-ing previous work.


### Single commit rebase 
squash all commits and then rebase. Given changes have happened, has a risk of "fucking up".

Solution : go for hard-way rebase


### Merge conflict notes

Abstract class create feed statement

#### Merge conflicts solved

Next step : we redo changes in an "addition way".

### Adding more stuff

SQL++ support for csv and JSON output
