### Middleware Setting

Collage paper says that Collage compares to ORMs (in conventional engineering) and static program rewriting in research arena. Is this true?

**Note** : This is true only in a middleware setting. In a semistructured database setting, the comparison is meaningless.

### Semi Structured Query Processor Setting

Yannis says that he sees Collage as a query decorrelation technique specifically for semistructured data. Is that sensible? How novel is it in this arena?

### Collage with Java or Stand Alone

Collage can be used with Java (using Spring or Struts) or in stand-alone mode (with special statement such that the `fstmt-for` and `fstmt-with`). In that sense, it is comparable to other holistic optimization techniques (Ferry, statusQuo and DBridge).  

### Major Background Topics :

 - Query decorrelation (all except StatusQuo)
 - ORMs (all)
 - Hoare Logic (StatusQuo)
 - Control Flow Graph (DBridge)
