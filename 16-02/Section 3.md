## Section 3

The objective of section is to prepare the data model, query language and algebra. The current plan is :

 1. Present the SQL++ Query language. We only present features of SQL++ which are directly relevant to the problem at hand. We refer to the SQL++ paper for the remaining features. For supported clauses, refer to section 2 of the SQL++ paper. Data Model Features at hand include:
    - Primitive Values
    - Tuple Values
    - Collection Values (Arrays and Bags)
    - Null value (no missing)
 2. Present the SQL++ query pattern considered
 3. Show the operators (refer to existing paper for inspiration).
 4. Show and describe the tuple-at-a-time execution plan.
