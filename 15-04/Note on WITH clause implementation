### Note on WITH clause implementation

The `WITH` clause implementation is done with an `AssignOperator` possibly with a `SubplanOperator` as input (when the expression of the clause is a subquery).

The `GROUP BY` operator's default behavior is to take package all variables included in scope into the `group` variable. This would include any variable created with the `WITH` clause. In most cases the `WITH` clause is a subquery with a large result, therefore including the `WITH` clause variable in the `group` package doesn't seem appropriate (this should be discussed with Yannis). As a precaution, we currenlty exclude variables generated by the `WITH` clause from the `group` package.
