### Blog info

 - Start a blog for research exam. One report per week. Should be well written, not just a series of notes.
 - First report should be about initial thoughts before starting reading suggested by yannis.
 - More notes in blog section of files on top level shelf.
 - Consider https://divshot.com instead of Heroku for setup. Seems better than wordpress for developpers.
