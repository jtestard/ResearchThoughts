### Meeting with Yannis on Romain's findings
 - Operator pull down has been clearly motivated in Romain's examples by showing that for given queries there are no plans a source agnostic query rewriter could come up with that could be compatible with any source combination.
 - In the next step, we need to define how we intend to rewrite the queries at the source aware stage.
 - Unfortunately, operator pull down cannot always fix our problem directly, and some algebraic transformations have to be made first. 
   - **Job 1** : Go over Romain's examples and see what exactly are these extra rewritings.
 - A similar problem has been solved already in the literature of answering queries using views :
   - **Job 2** : Go over Alon Levy's survey on the topic and try to find an inspiration about how to solve this problem.
 - Finally, **Job 3** : we need to find a systematic way to transform our source agnostic plans into some normal form that can be transformed by source-aware rewriters.
 - Note : for now, we leave aside the holistic approach and continue with the two stage approach discussed previously.
