#### Summary from Kian Win and Romain's meeting :
 - We focus on equality-based selections :
 	- Selections are the most selective type of operations that can be pushed at a source.
 	- Selections based on equality are the most common types of selections.
 	- We assume selection predicates are written in conjunctive normal forms.
 - Focus on equality predicates for selection push down.
 - Existing configurations for equality function : 
 	- complex
 	- type mismatch
 	- nulls
 	- missings
 	- null_missing
 - Feature dependence : 
    - Each rewriting can add or remove features. 
 	
####Questions remaining
 - Dimensions equality selection rewriting rules :
   - configurations (mentionned above) : there must be a rewriting rule for each configuration.
   - order (which order should rewriting rules be in) : can rewriting rules be applied in a deterministic order?
   - source-specific : should rewriting rules be source specific or source agnostic.
   - comparisons : comparisons can be between :
     - two variables
     - a variable and a literal
     - two literals
   - features : clearly show which feature can be added/removed between each rewriting rule.
   - Need to formalize the rewriters

   
####Plan of presentation

 - Present how we want to implement selection pushdown ; using two selections :
   - P_S : selection pushed to source. 
   - P_{\bar{S}} : selection that could not be pushed to source.  
 - Show on one example how we would wish to decompose the query. The example should involve all possible rewriting rules.
   - complex equality
   - type mismatch equality
   - variable to null equality
   - variable to missing equality
   - missing to null equality (recall that missing happens when path navigation fails)
