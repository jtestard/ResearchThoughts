### Meeting with Yannis
 - Example 4 (join example) is motivated by another problem, which is dynamic middle ware query optimization (how to keep good plans given lack of statistics).
 - Current approach is to focus on the definition of the source agnostic rewriter and assume problems would arise from the lack of information about sources.
 - Maybe what we would want to do is look at the survey paper and look at the "-" in the capability matrices, which outline capability limitations.
 - We can also build our own example using existing query and devise algorithm that would suffice for our purposes.
