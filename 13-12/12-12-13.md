## RETHINKING THE DISTRIBUTED QUERY PROCESSOR ##

We also only care in our algorithm about where the relation CAN be stored 
rather than where they are stored already stored. This should be added to our heuristics.
 ==> This is not a real concern since table scans always have only one source. **solved**

We have not yet considered queries in which tables are split across nodes. 
Is this assumption? Has this assumption been deliberate? Need to ask Kian Win about this. 
=> Maybe we need to consider fragments.

INGRES is only done on a two step process in which it first transforms a graph into a tree 
of joins simplifying nodes using MRQ's (Mono Relation Queries) and then considers only these
 joins. Moreover, it only considers joins whose operands are on different sources. 
 Can we do something like that ?

We did not define our network type. INGRES has different techniques for general and broadband
 networks. I am assuming we are using a 1 to 1 communication network.

INGRES chooses a site where the processing for a subquery should be done and then 
ships data to that site to minimize communication cost Epstein et al. [1978]. 
Using the formula <img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\sum_{i=1}^{n}size(R_i^j)>
\sum_{i=1}^{n}size(R_i^{j+1})">border="0"/>, they decide which site *j* should be used at 
each step.

The technique uses 

What is our algorithm doing? Are we just trying to beat the exhaustive version presented by 
[Selinger and Adiba, 1980; Lohman et al., 1985] (in which case we are optimizing compile time 
queries only), or are we trying to attempt a dynamic or hybrid algorithm?
Are we using a hybrid approach or a static/dynamic approach? As far as I have I understand it,
we are using a static approach (with dynamic programming used to reduce the set of options).

The textbook also covers an approach about how to join two relations in a distributed system. There are three options for 
<img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?R \bowtie S" border="0"/>:
 - join at site of R.
 - join at site of S.
 - join at some third party site.
 And two ways to join :
 - join as ship whole
 - join  as fetch as needed


### Meeting planning ###

We should revisit what was said on November 4th with a new perspective 
given by our knowledge of the INGRES model as well as the "state of the art" 
distribution query processing.

Preprocessing optimization :

Dynamic Programming pruning :

Show work done on Problem example. Show also work on blackboard. The idea is to 
enumerate all solution sets A,B,M and find the one with minimum cost. Finding the set 
of solutions can be done separately grin choosing the solution with minimum cost.

Talk about INGRES, static vs dynamic approaches, in general all the remarks about what 
was found in the book.

Finally, if time permits we can talk about integrating semi join in our algorithm.



### NEXT STEP ###

#### SEMI JOIN REDUCTION ####
 - identify class of queries used for semi joins. 
 - prominent class of queries 
 - find more equivalence rules.
 - what are the conditions when a rewriting rule would fire.


#### HOLISTIC DP ####

 - We should be looking at the semantics of the dependency graph in order to keep n-ary joins. Don't have the option graph. then the new semantics allows you to generate a new set of plans for the DP.
 - Say how the new semantics of the n ary allows you to generate plans for the dp, without any pruning and without assumptions.
 - We have an idea for the pruning based on these assumptions for unary operators.
 - Extend the pruning to capture binary or nary operators.
 - Static vs Dynamic vs Hybrid ? (**Hortogonal Concern**)

WE have gone over both the text book and the overview by Donald Kossman. Here 
are the topics that are explored : 
 - A \join B = A (B \semijoin \pi(A))
 - Bloom filters
 - Bit arrays
 - Client server domain.
 - used as an alternative for joins, they are useful when the processing cost is less significant.
