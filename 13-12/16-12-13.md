## SEMI JOIN PRESENTATION ##
 - The Kossman paper shows how much work has been done on semi-join reduction in the context of dynamic programming distributed query optimization.
 - The literature does not contain any reference to the use of semi-join reductions in aggregation queries.
 - We know have to do our own research.

### EQUIVALENCE RULES ###

### SUGGESTED VARIANT TO SEMI JOIN REDUCTION ###

Original :
 - @s1 : R' = \pi (R), send R' to s2.
 - @s2 : R'' = R \semijoin S (or S \semijoin R), send to s1
 - @s1 : R \join S = R \join R''
 
Variant for case A :
 - Same as original except aggregation is done at site 1 once R \join S is obtained.

Variant for case B :
 - @s2 : R' = \pi(S), send R' to s1.
 - @s1 : R'' = \agg(R) \semijoin R', send R'' to s2.
 - @s2 : \agg(R) \join S = R'' \join S
 
Variant for case C & D :
 - @s2 : R' = \pi ( \agg(S)). Send R' to s1. 
 - @s1 : R'' = \agg(R) \semijoin \R'. Send R'' to s2.
 - @s2 : \agg(R) \join \agg(S) = R'' \join \agg(S)

### USEFULNESS ###

### SET VS BAG semantics ###
The scenario shows that set semantics are not required (at least for cases 2,3 and 4).
