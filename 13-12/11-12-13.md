## SEMI JOIN REDUCTION ##


Finished and Submitted final exam cse 200 this morning. Still on the Kossman paper.

Dynamic Programming for Query processing:

2.2.1
First enumerates all unary plans, and then enumerates binary plans by construction (similar to our DP algorithm).


2.2.2

Cost Estimation for plans : Classic cost model. 


continued lecture required : stop watching movies :p

Recall concept of functional dependency.
Given some Relation R(a1,a2,a3).
We say there is a functional dependency <img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?f:a_i \rightarrow a_j" border="0"/> if :
All tuple with value x for attribute ai have value y for attribute aj.
*Full* functional dependency are one-to-one mappings between attributes, where *partial* FD’s only go from ai to aj.

Spatial databases : Databases optimized to store geometrical (2D and possibly 3D) objects.

### SEARCH ###
Topics mentioned in Kossman’s paper:  
 - Semi strucutured Data and XML (Abiteboul)
 - Data management in asymmetric communication environments. (Acharya)
 - broadcast disks (Acharya)
 - push and pull broadcast (Acharya)
 - Heterogeneous databases
 - query caching optimization in distributed metdiator systems (Adali)
 - Compilers and Databases (Aho & Ullman)
 - Scheduling (Apers)
 - database imll using specialized hardware(Apers)
 - Functional Join Processing (Kossman) *important*
 - Database patchwork intenet (Braumandl)
 - multidatabase transaction management (Braumandl)
 - reducing « braking distance » of SQL engine.
 - … list too long to be complete. going only over important flags  only.

 - Distributed Databases, principles and systems. (seems too old to mention any interesting stuff though).
 - Optimization of dynamic query evaluation plans.


My findings is that up to 2000, semi join reduction has not been studied outside of the context of joins. I am now moving on the search to  papers later than 2000.

Google scholar searches using the following keywords do not yield direct result (with year >2000):
 - semi join reduction aggregation databases
 - semi join reduction group by databases

In general, it seems that papers from after 2000 which deal with distributed query processing try to implement it for a specific environment (such as map reduce)

### SEARCHES Attempted up to know: ###

#### google scholar ####
Each google scholar search means going through papers in the 3 first pages of the search and look for papers which cover topic seemingly similar to what we are looking for.

 - semi join reduction aggregation databases
 - semi join reduction group by databases

Papers investigated : 
 - MOCHA
 - Architecture of Pier: internet scale query processor.
 - Top k spatial joins
 - Efficient processing of data warehousing in a split execution environment

See previous days for other searches.

### INGRES ALGORITHM ###
In this section I am going over the INGRES Distributed algorithm.
Here are the assumptions made : 
 - No need to distinguish between a fragment of a relation and another relation.
 - INGRES makes the assumption that joins with two tables stored at the same relation are not considered by the algorithm. In other words, only join queries whose operand relations are stored at different sites are considered.
 - Relation transfers are done using set a time semantics (not tuple at a time sematics).
 
 INGRES is a dynamic programming algorithm whose objective function is two-fold : 
  - Reducing communication time
  - Reducing response time
  
  However, these objectives are sometimes conflicting. Both general and broadcast networks are considered (recall that broadcast networks are those in which the cost of sending from one source to another is the same as sending to all other sources (or a subset thereof)).
 
 The input is a multi relation query MRQ in CNF form with schema and network information.
 
 ##### Step 1 ####
All mono relation queries ORQ that can be detached from MRQ are first processed locally. 

#### Step 2 ####
Then the MRQ is split into irreducible subqueries using the reduction algorithm [Wong and Youssefi, 1976] (note that all of the subqueries are multi relational, given that the mono relation queries have already been taken care of).

#### Step 3 ####

Stopped on bottom of page 276. To be continued...
