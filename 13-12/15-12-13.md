## SEMI JOIN REDUCTION LECTURE ##

Today we go over semi join reduction as a lecture. We cover four different topics that have been discussed for the research :

 - identify class of queries used for semi joins.  
 - find more equivalence rules.
 - what are the conditions when a rewriting rule would fire.
 
 ### CLASS OF QUERIES USED FOR SEMI JOIN ###
 
 Semi join reduction is used in the context of distributed database systems when the two operands of a relation A \join B are in two
 different sources, say s1 and s2.
 
 - Semi joins reduce the size of the data being transferred but increases processing cost. 
 - When considering a join between A and B, in a theta-join context we would:
   - ship the smallest of A and B to the other site, and then execute the join.
 - But really what is necessary to execute the join is only the attribute that are being matched in the join's condition.
 - In a semi join reduction:
   - we project the attributes required for the matching for the two operands say A (WLOG), this is an extra processing cost.
   - we send the projected attribute to the site of B, which is an extra transfer cost.
   - we do a semi join of \project(A) and B and store the result in the intermediate table R.
   - we send R back to the site of A.
 - We can see that semi join are only interesting if R is much smaller than A, since we incur an extra cost execution cost. 
 - In other words, the semi join is useful iff :
   - exec_cost(\project(A)) + tr_cost(\project(A)) + exec_cost(R=\semijoin(\project(A),B) + tr_cost(R) + exec_cost(\join(R,A))
   - smaller than
   - tr_cost(A) + exec_cost(\join(A,B))
 - In other words, the class of queries for which the semi join is useful are :
   - queries where the join condition has high selectivity.
   - queries in which the transfer cost between peers is much higher than the execution of an operation.
   - queries in which both operand sites have join capabilities (which may not be the case with NOSQL databases).
   - queries which include tables with media data, where \project(A) is much smaller than A.
   - some queries in client-server systems (see Braumandl & al, 1999) :
     - Clients can communicate with servers, servers cannot communicate between themselves. Query looks like:
       - SELECT *
       - FROM A , B, C
       - WHERE A.a = B.a AND A.b = C.b
       - Server 1 contains (A,B) and Server 2 contains (A,C)
     - ![compare_plans](https://raw.github.com/jtestard/ResearchThoughts/master/cs_plans_compare.png) 
 - Likewise, semi join reductions are not useful when:
   - transfer costs are not so significant (in very fast networks).
   - queries where the join condition has low selectivity.
   - the initial semijoin reduction could only be applied to tree queries [BG81](http://delivery.acm.org/10.1145/330000/322238/p25-bernstein.pdf?ip=128.54.40.25&id=322238&acc=ACTIVE%20SERVICE&key=C2716FEBFA981EF147DAD23CB8BFD2078D75470BC0F2371B&CFID=271541014&CFTOKEN=86181360&__acm__=1387221748_8c658640cca7c11a5667795a46d5cc12)
   - tree queries are queries with non-cyclic clauses for joins (no transitivity).

### SEARCH SPACE FOR SEMI JOIN REDUCTIONS (Kossmann 2001) ###
In this article, Kossman studies the use of semi join reducers in "modern" DBMS (2000's era). He, however, focuses only
on select,project,join queries. This is not what we are 
In the study of the search space, we consider joins and semi joins (Kossmann also considers thin joins, but we do not need to).
 - semi joins requires multiple occurence of the same table in query plans (e.g. (A \semijoin B) \join B
 - A \join B \join B or A \semijoin B \semijoin B are not allowed.
 - The complete search space of join and semijoin is studied (above these restrictions).
   
### FIND MORE EQUIVALENCE RULES ###

These are the rules found so far :

I have also found that semijoin relational algebra and join relational algebra are equivalent in terms of
[expressivness](http://alpha.uhasselt.be/~lucp1080/projection.pdf).

### CONDITIONS FOR FIRING OF REWRITING RULES ###

This question pertains more to the architecture of a particular system implementing semi joins rather than a question
about semi join reductions (SMR) in general. 
 - We could ask the reverse question, what are the conditions not to fire semi join reduction rewriting rules in a system. 
 - This could be used as a pruning technique to reduce the search space of queries. 
 - We can say that rewriting rules for semi join reduction aren't fired when the optimizer identifies conditions which rule out semi joins.
 - Such conditions could be :
   - very fast communication networks (local area networks, database server clusters...)
   - expensive UDF function used as join conditions.
   - join with operands located at a source join capabilities.
     - SMR might still be interesting for a subset of operands or if a third source is available.

### SEMIJOINS AND DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING ###
Implementing semijoins in state of the art distributed optimizers (which use dynamic programming) is explained in the 2001 Kossmann
paper *Integerating Semi-join Reducers in State-Of-The-Art Query Processors*.
There are three algorithms. The classic DP (very similar to ours), this is applied in a client server system (which may be relevant to forward).
 - Classic DP : ![classic_dp](https://raw.github.com/jtestard/ResearchThoughts/master/classicDP.png)
 - Accessroot :
   - In this algorithm, semijoins are computed before the joins in order to reduce the size of the base tables before transfer. 
   - Plans are then moved through the data structure opt plan on line N9 to their appropriate level (size for subset).
   - This moving allows for further pruning.
   - ![access_root](https://raw.github.com/jtestard/ResearchThoughts/master/accessroot.png)
 - Joinroot :
   - This more complex variant allows us to enumerate plans we could not with the previous algorithms, e.g. for the ```OptPlan({A,B,C})```:
     - ![variants](https://raw.github.com/jtestard/ResearchThoughts/master/variants.png)
   - ![join_root](https://raw.github.com/jtestard/ResearchThoughts/master/joinroot.png)
 - The approach is meant to work with middleware systems.

### PERFORMANCE INCREASE ###
Situations in which the algorithms in Kossman's article increase performance:
 - the more predicates contained the more advantageous *join root* becomes.
 - *join root* and *access root* running time increase extensively with the number of tables involved in a query.
 - limited benefits are observed in symmetric communication, but very good performance is observed in client server settings.


### WHAT DO COMMERCIAL SYSTEMS DO ###
 - We have two sites s1 and s2, both running on the same DDBMS.
 - s1 contains some table CUSTOMER(id(primary key),name,age,balance)
 - s2 contains a table PRODUCT(id(primary key),name,cost,available)
 - We are interested in the plan executed by the DDBMS, what does it do when we add aggregations to the mix?
 - Consider the query : "What is the number of products that Andy can buy?"
   - SELECT COUNT(PRODUCT.id) AS NumberOfProducts
   - FROM CUSTOMER,PRODUCT
   - WHERE CUSTOMER.name='Andy' AND PRODUCT.cost <= CUSTOMER.balance

#### Candidate DDBMS ####
 - PostgreSQL XC (distributed version of postgres). We can use the EXPLAIN postgres command to get the query plan.
