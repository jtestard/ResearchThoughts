RESEARCH

Goal : Establish an algorithm that implements heuristics in the holistic DP by interleaving them with the current algorithm and using super vertices.


———————————————
UNARY OPERATORS
———————————————
We already know how to obtain this algorithm when considering only unary operators. 


————————————————
BINARY OPERATORS
————————————————
However, when we add binary operators into the mix, we do not really know how to proceed. Here is what we know.

Assumptions :
	-	Plans will eventually be sent to sources which have their own query optimizers therefore there is no point in optimizing a query in the distributor if all of its elements are destined to the same source, unless that source is the mediator.
	-	We know how to linearly choose the best plan for a set of purely unary operators.
	-	When a join is condensing, it is always preferable to include it in the same source as its children in the dependency graph.
	-	We do not consider execution cost of operator. Therefore we only want to minimize transfer time across sources.

Tools available to generate plans / super vertices : 
	-	approximate size of the input and output tables for each operator for a given plan (in other words, only if we know the size of the path) [dynamic]
	-	knowledge of the degree of selectivity of an operator (and thus knowledge whether an operator is condensing or not),regardless of plans [static]
	-	sources, physical impls (order, materialization, implementation…), arity and type of each operator [static]
	-	Any static information we can use in a pre processing phase. Any dynamically retrieved information can only be use during the iterations of the holistic DP.
