## Unique Plan Problem 
 - We already have one example of the unique plan problem which involves : 
   - Expensive UDF
   - Database heterogeniety (SQL and MongoDB)
   - Operators (Select, Project, Join) 
   - No data model heterogeneity
   - No soure configuration heterogeneity

We are looking for motivations for operator pull-down in other settings.

#### Directions 
 - Add data model heterogeneity
 - Add OLO (Order By, Limit, Offset) operators
 - Add GBH (Group By, Having) operators
 - Add source configuration heterogeneity  

#### Look for classic settings
 - Looking at Informatica.
 
#### Yannis's opinion
While example 1 and 3 (which make use of the UDF function) are good, example 2 :
 - cannot be solved using operator pull down (my opinion)
 - can be reproduced (somewhat) without heterogenity
 - is focused on the physical aspects (which is arguably the case of other examples as well).
