### Yannis's opinion
While example 1 and 3 (which make use of the UDF function) are good, example 2 :
 - cannot be solved using operator pull down (my opinion)
 - can be reproduced (somewhat) without heterogenity
 - is focused on the physical aspects (which is arguably the case of other examples as well).

### New examples

#### GroupBy
 - Using groupby, we can reproduce examples similar to 1 and 3.
 
#### Order By
 - Physical plans become handy
   - MergeSort Joins becomes very efficient if the input tables are ordered.
 - Sources are not aware of what kind of order could be beneficial to some other source.
 - Can middleware rewriters introduce the right orders? Or should it be the source wrapper's responsibility?

#### Problem 1 : CQL OrderBy
Suggested example :
 - CQL can only use order-by on clustering attributes.
 - Suggested plan include a sort merge join and an ordering of CQL table using non-clustering attribute.
 => false : Sorting can happen at the site of the join as well

Intuition : Heterogeneity example would be the most interesting.
Maybe try to play the heterogeneity card coupled with the physical implementation.

### New Idea : Specifying contiguous sub plans
When we say contiguous sub plan, what do we mean? How do we handle plans that are sent from one source to another?
