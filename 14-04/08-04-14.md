Two problems :
 - Can a DNF be constructed ?
 - Can we motivate operator pull down?

#### Can a DNF be constructed

 - A unique Distributed Normal Form(DNF) cannot be obtained if : 
   - There exists a query *Q* such that there are no generic (source unaware) plan *PQ* that can be *efficient* for all of the underlying sources of the DNF.
   - I would add that the *PQ* should also be unaware of the data model (given data sources are unknown).
