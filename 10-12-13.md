## SEMI JOIN REDUCTION (CONTINUED) ##
——————

This morning I have been writing the documentation for the iPhoneComposerApp. I have also sent an email to Shlomo Dubnov about our next meeting for me to explain how the system works.

### State of The Art Distributed Query Processing (Continued) ###

Plan Refinement is the step that transforms a plan produced by an optimizer into an executable plan.
The Catalog is where the meta information about the queries is stored. This meta information helps for parsing, rewriting and optimizing a query. It stores : 
 - The schema of relations.
 - The partitioning schema  (information about how tables have been partitioned in a distributed setting and how they can be reconstructed).
 - Phy

### Distributed Databases TextBook ###

Join Ordering in Distributed Query Processing. Includes information about semi join reduction in the case of multiple joins, which includes a lot of challenges of different nature. In the case of multiple distributed joins, there is an exponential number of semi join program, with at least one being optimal. We call it the full reducer.
The textbook also covers the dynamic INGRES approach as well as how to combine it with the semi join reduction in detail, this is a must read but not what we are looking for.
