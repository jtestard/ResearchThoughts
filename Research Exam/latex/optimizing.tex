In order to be relevant, a PP system needs to perform at least as well as any given single system solution. Optimization is particularly relevant in the context of queries targeting multiple subsystems, where the joining of data must be coordinated by the PP system. Depending on the architecture and design choices made for the subsystem integration, different kinds of optimization may be applied.
