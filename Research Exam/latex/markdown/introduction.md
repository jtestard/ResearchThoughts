# Introduction

The introduction should give the setting of the research exam and expose the problem we are trying to solve. It must :

 1. Explain the background and emergence of the Polyglot Persistence problem.
 - Go over the challenges the problem impose
 - Introduct a running example to be used throughout the survey

### Challenges

#### How to choose which systems to integrate given a set of requirements?

 - There is a wide variety of systems.
 - Multiple systems may fit the primary need of an application.
 - How to decide between a SQL or NoSQL system
 - Especially when application isn't well defined, benchmarking is not easy.
 - We will view a number of tools suggested as a solution, which were previously surveyed by. 


 
 

### Example from Yupeng

*It is widely believed that mobile will be the future of IT. As tablets and smartphones go places on the sales front, the increasing demand for mobile applications is happening on the development side too. A recent survey from IBM [40] found that the number of developers working on mobile application will tremendously increase in the future.*

In this paragraph, Yupeng shows there is interest for his topic (mobile web applications) in the development community.

#### Mobile native applications and web applications

*Mobile applications are classified into two categories: mobile native applications and mobile web applications. A native application is specifically designed to run on a deviceâ€™s operating system and machine firmware, such as iPhone and Android, and typically needs to be adapted/adjusted for different devices; while a web application, or browser application, is one in which all or some parts of the software are downloaded from the Web each time it runs in the browser, and it can usually be accessed from all Web-capable mobile devices.*
*Traditionally native applications are superior in terms of performance and the only means to access device attributes such as geolocation API and camera. And web applications are favored by the developers for their cross-platform compatibility and the ability to update and maintain without distributing and installing software. Although native applications are argued to be necessary for certain types of apps, such as high- quality games, for many other types of applications, the economics of mobile software development and publishing favors the mobile web. Taptu [1] reports that by the end of year 2009 there are 326,000 Mobile Touch Web sites worldwide, comparing to 148,000 iPhone apps in the App Store and 24,000 apps in the Android market.*

*Moreover, The browser-based mobile web market is expected to grow much faster than the native app market, as the user experiences provided by both types of applications are increasingly blurred due to HTML5 being more and more popular. With the support for HTML5, the platform-independent open standard, being rolled out in most browsers, it is getting easier and easier for the developers to create rich user experiences with the mobile browser without having to create platform-specific applications. These features include (1) client-side local storage and files cache for offline support, which we will address in details in section 3.1; (2) APIs that gaining direct access to the hardware (camera, GPS,etc) (3) more markup formats to improve mobile web applications, for instance, the email input type that mobile browsers could customize their onscreen keyboard to make it easier to type email addresses. Today, there are already some good examples of mobile web applications utilizing HTML5 features, including mobile Gmail, Google Maps, and navigation apps.*
