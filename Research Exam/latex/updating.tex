Updating data in any database systems poses the problem of consistency guarantees in the presence of multiple concurrent updates. The CAP theorem ~\cite{Gilbert2002} states that a distributed system can either be immediately consistent or always available, but not both. In the case of polyglot persistence, this means if an update to multiple subsystems has to be immediately consistent, then the PP system won't be available until all of the subsystems involved have been properly updated. Moreover, the subsystems themselves may have different consistency/availability tradeoffs which may have to be reconciled. How can we describe the availability and consistency characteristics of a PP system?
